The bbb-aws-hibernate package has two components, one to stop the system and the other to start it.

Stopping the system
===================

Install the bbb-aws-hibernate package.  We don't have a make target to build it.  The 'fpm' command is
currently in the repository for the old build system (~/src/bigbluebutton-build/packages-template/bbb-aws-hibernate).

An AWS policy needs to be installed to give the instance permission to hibernate itself.  You don't want a role
attached to the instance, because that would allow any user on the instance to hibernate it.  Instead, create
a role and give an access key pair to the bbb-aws-hibernate service.  Not sure exactly how I'm doing that currently.
Check the configuration on collaborate.freesoft.org or itpietraining.com; both work.

Starting the system
===================

This is done using a signed JWT key, created using an SSH RSA key by the bbb-mklogin program.

In the configuration.py file, set the CONFIG dictionary as explained in the documentation at the top of the file:
   - the name to give to the bbb-mklogin '-n' switch
   - the FQDN of the server
   - the AWS instance ID of the server, and any associated instances to started with it
   - the SSH RSA public keys that can be used to sign the JWT keys

Run 'make'.  It might error out with the message "An update is in progress".  If so, just run it again and it should work the second time.

The AWS URL will be stored in the bbb-auth.sqlite file in the parent directory (collaborate), so that it can be accessed by
both the make command and the bbb-mklogin command.

Once that's done, you can run bbb-mklogin with the -n option to create a URL that can auto-start the server.

IMPORTANT: You need to put the RSA key's public key in /etc/bigbluebutton/authorized_keys on the server.
