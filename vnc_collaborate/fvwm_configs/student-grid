Style * SkipMapping

# Most windows (i.e, the grid view) appear on desktop 0.  A zoomed
# student view appears on desktop 1, so that any changes to the grid
# (i.e, students coming and going) get made to desktop 0 and are
# invisible until the zoom ends on desktop 1.

# Grid panes are done with ssvncviewer whose title starts with "TeacherViewVNC".
# Older zoomed student views are done with ssvncviewer and are named "Zoomed Student Desktop"
# Newer method is tigervncviewer, which doesn't support the -title option, so it's called "TigerVNC Viewer"
# Both the older and the newer method are currently in use, since the newer method doesn't support scaling
#   and the older method can't handle cut-and-paste.
