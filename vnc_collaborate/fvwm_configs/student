# Styling for the desktop pager: "Font none" prevents display of the
# desktop number, which we don't want the user to change because we
# use it to overlay screenshares (see below).  The remaining options
# are more obvious - it always stays on the top of the display, and
# it's iconify and maximize buttons are fairly useless and take up
# too much space in its small title-bar.

# The teacher can project VNC viewers onto the student desktops.
#
# Projections are identified by the title string "OverlayVNC".
#
# Projections appear on the very top (layer 10) and have no decorations at all,
# so as to completely obscure the student's other windows until they end.
#
# When they appear, we put them on desktop 1, move to desktop 1, and disable all mouse bindings.
# Once they're gone, we move back to desktop 0 and re-enable mouse bindings.
