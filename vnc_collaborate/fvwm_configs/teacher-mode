Style * SkipMapping

# Most windows (i.e, the grid view) appear on desktop 0.  A zoomed
# student view appears on desktop 1, so that any changes to the grid
# (i.e, students coming and going) get made to desktop 0 and are
# invisible until the zoom ends on desktop 1.

# Older zoomed student views are done with ssvncviewer and are named "Zoomed Student Desktop"
# Newer method is tigervncviewer, which doesn't support the -title option, so it's called "TigerVNC Viewer"

# The Tk windows are the window labels and the "end screenshare"

# MAJOR FEATURE: when the teacher clicks on a miniaturized student desktop,
# we launch a "zoomed" view of that desktop that is fully interactive.
# We need to remove the mouse binding to allow the zoomed view to
# work right.  When the teacher exits the zoomed view, we replace
# the mouse binding.  We also switch to desktop 1 for the zoomed view.
