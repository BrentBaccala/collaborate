# MAJOR FEATURE: when the teacher clicks on a miniaturized student desktop,
# we launch a "zoomed" view of that desktop that is fully interactive.
# We need to remove the mouse binding to allow the zoomed view to
# work right.  When the teacher exits the zoomed view, we replace
# the mouse binding.  We also iconify (which means vanish, because
# icons are turned off) all of the miniaturized viewers and their
# labels for the duration of the zoom.

# I call StartFunction here because some of these things didn't get
# put in the right layers, probably because they were mapped after
# fvwm started
